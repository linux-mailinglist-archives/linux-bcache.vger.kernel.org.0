I have a backing device that is constantly writing due to 
bcache_writebac. It has been at 14.3.MB dirty all day and has not 
changed. There's nothing else writing to it.

This started after I "upgraded" from Fedora 29 to 30 and consequently 
from kernel 5.2.18 to 5.3.6.

You can see from the info below that the writeback process is chewing 
upÂ  A LOT of CPU and writing constantly at ~7MB/s. It sure looks like 
it's in an infinite loop and writing the same data over and over. At 
least I hope that's the case and it's not just filling the array with 
garbage.

This configuration has been stable for many years and across many Fedora 
upgrades. The host has ECC memory so RAM corruption should not be a 
concern. I have not had any recent controller or drive failures.

I have not tried reverting back to an earlier kernel. I'm concerned 
about possible corruption. Is that safe? Any other suggestions as to how 
to debug and/or resolve this issue?

Thank you,
