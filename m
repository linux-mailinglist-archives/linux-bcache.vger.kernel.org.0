[Sorry again for the SPAM detection]

Thank you the reply Coly!

I agree that this patch is not a final solution for fixing the
fragmentation issue, but more like a workaround to alleviate this
problem.
So, part of my intention is to look for how upstream would like to fix
this issue.

I've looked into the code of moving_gc part, as well as did some
debug/test, unfortunately, I think it's not the solution for this
issue also.
Because movnig_gc will not just move the dirty cache, but also the
clean cache, so seems the purpose of moving_gc
is trying to move the data (dirty and clean) from those relatively
empty buckets to some new buckets, so that to reclaim the original
buckets.
For this purpose, I guess moving gc was more useful at the time when
we usually don't have large nvme devices.

Let's get back to the problem I have, the problem that I'm trying to
fix is that you might have lots of buckets (Say 70 percent) that are
all being fully consumed,
while those buckets only contain very few dirty data (Say 10 percent
), since gc can't reclaim a bucket which contains any dirty data, so
the worst situation
is that the cache_availability_percent can drop under 30 percent which
will make all the write op can't perform in a writeback mode, thus
kill the performance of writes.

So, unlike the moving_gc, I only want to move dirty data around (as
you've suggested :)), but I don't think it's a good idea to change the
behavior of moving_gc.
My current idea is to implement a compaction thread that triggers the
dirty data compaction only under some certain circumstances (like when
the fragmentaion and dirty buckets are both high), and this thread can
be turned on/off based on an extra option, so that people can keep the
original behavior if they want.

This is a rough idea now, could you please let me know if the above
thought makes sense to you or any other suggestions will be
appreciated!
I also understand the hardest part is making sure the general bcache
performance and functionality still look sane,
so it might require much more time to do it and it's more likely a
feature atm.

How to reproduce and observe this issue:
This issue is very easy to repreduce by running below fio command
against a writeback mode bcache deivce:

fio --name=random-writers --filename=/dev/bcache0 --ioengine=libaio
--iodepth=4 --rw=randrw --rate_iops=95,5 --bs=4k --direct=1
--numjobs=4

Note that the key option to reproduce this issue here is
"rate_iops=95,5", so that you will have 95 percent read and only 5
percent write, this is to make sure
one bucket only contains very few dirty data.
Also, it's faster to reproduce this with a small cache device, I use
1GB cache, but it's same for bigger cache device, just a matter of
time.

We can observe this issue by monitoring bcache stats "data_dirty" and
"cache_available_percent", after the cache_available_percent dropped
to 30 percent,
we can observe the write performance is hugely degraded by below
bpftrace script:
---
#!/usr/bin/env bpftrace

#include <linux/bio.h>

kprobe:cached_dev_make_request
{
   @start[arg1] = nsecs;
}

kprobe:bio_endio /@start[arg0]/
{
 if(((struct bio *)arg0)->bi_opf & 1) {
    @write = hist(nsecs - @start[arg0]); delete(@start[arg0]);
 }
 else {
    @read = hist(nsecs - @start[arg0]); delete(@start[arg0]);
 }
}
---

To run this scriptï¼š
Save above bpftrace file to bcache_io_lat.bt, then run it with chmod
+x bcache_io_lat.bt & ./bcache_io_lat.bt

By the way, we mainly hit this issue on ceph, the fio reproducer is
just an easy way to reproduce it.

Regards,
Dongdong
