This means that bcache already detached the faulty cache device. The data
that was cached but not written to the backing devices is now lost. (I don't
expect it to be recoverable, but don't take my word for it.) The logs from
your initial message say that the cache was dirty, so there *was* some
non-written data in the cache.

You can now try to check the BTRFS devices, preferably in read-only mode.
(It's important in case you would try to recoved the lost cached data.)
Since you mentioned you had a backup, probably there isn't much sense in
trying to recover the data, so you could just try to mount the BTRFS
filesystem instead. Maybe compare the filesystem contents with what was
restored from the backup, if you are curious (and if the filesystem can be
mounted). Maybe do btrfs scrub, too.
