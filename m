It is removed because it is not completed, a working mirror cache in
bcache is not that simple like submitting bios to all cache device and
waiting for all of them completed. This might be one of the reason why
this feature is not production ready after 10+ years since bcache merged
into mainline kernel.

I see many production environments using md raid1 for cached data
duplication. This is the preferred method IMHO.
