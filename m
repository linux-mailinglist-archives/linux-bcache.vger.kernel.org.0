Coly is right: there are some issues to address.  

Coly, I do not wish to contradict you, only to add that we have had times 
where this would be useful. I like the idea, particularly avoiding placing 
dm-linear atop of the bdev which reduces the IO codepath.  Maybe there is 
an implementation that would fit everyone's needs.

For us, such a superblock-less registration could resolve two issues:

1. Most commonly we wish to add bcache to an existing device without
   re-formatting and without adding the dm-linear complexity.

2. Relatedly, IMHO, I've never liked the default location at 8k because we 
   like to align our bdev's to the RAID stride width and rarely is the 
   bdev array aligned at 8k (usually 64k or 256k for hardware RAID).  If 
   we forget to pass the --data-offset at make-bcache time then we are 
   stuck with an 8k-misalignment for the life of the device.

In #2 we usually reformat the volume to avoid dm-linear complexity (and in 
both cases we have wanted writeback cache support).  This process can take 
a while to `dd` ‾30TBs of bdev on spinning disks and we have to find 
temporary disk space to move that data out and back in.

In the ioctl changes for bch_write_bdev_super() there does not appear to 
be a way to handle attaching caches to the running bcache.  For example:

1. Add a cacheless bcache0 volume via ioctl
2. Attach a writeback cache, write some data.
3. Unregister everything
4. Re-register the _dirty_ bdev from #1

In this scenario bcache will start "running" immediately because it 
cannot update its cset.uuid (as reported by bcache-super-show) which I 
believe is stored in cache_sb.set_uuid.  

I suppose in step #2 you could update your userspace state with the 
cset.uuid so your userspace ioctl register tool would put the cset.uuid in 
place, but this is fragile without good userspace integration.

I could imagine something like /etc/bcachetab (like crypttab or 
mdadm.conf) that maps cset UUID's to bdev UUIDs.  Then your userspace 
ioctl tool could be included in a udev script to auto-load volumes as they 
become available.

You want to make sure that when a dirty writeback-cached bdev is 
registered that it does not activate until either:

  1. The cache is attached
  2. echo 1 > /sys/block/bcache0/bcache/running

> - A new IOCTL interface added, even all rested interface are sysfs based.

True.  Perhaps something like this would be better, and it would avoid 
sharing a userspace page for blindly populating `struct cache_sb`, too:

  echo '/dev/bdev [bdev_uuid] [/dev/cachedev|cset_uuid] [options]' > ¥
          /sys/fs/bcache/register_raw

Because of the writeback issue above, the cache and bdev either need to be 
registered simultaneously or the cset uuid need to be specified.

An alternate implementation might be to create a dm-bcache target.  The 
core bcache code could be left alone except a few EXPORT_SYMBOL()'s so 
dm-bcache can reach the bcache registration bits.  

This would:
  * Minimally impact the bcache code base
  * Solve the blind-populating of `struct cache_sb` issue in the same way 
    as `register_raw` could work above.
  * Create a nicely segmented codebase (dm target) to upstream separately 
    through the DM team.
  * Could be maintained cleanly out-of-tree because the bcache 
    registration interfaces change very infrequently.
  * bdev resize could be done with a `dmsetup replace` but you'll need to 
    add resize support as below.

Resize is perhaps unrelated, so if you decide to tackle bdev or cachedev 
resize then please start a new list thread.  Briefly: supporting bdev 
resize is probably easy.  I've looked through the code a few times with 
this in mind but haven't had time.

Here's the summary, not sure if there are any other 
considerations:

  1. Create a sysfs file like /sys/block/bcache0/bcache/resize to trigger 
     resize on echo 1 >.
  2. Refactor the set_capacity() bits from  bcache_device_init() into its 
     own function.
  3. Put locks around bcache_device.full_dirty_stripes and 
     bcache_device.stripe_sectors_dirty.  Re-alloc+copy+free and zero the 
     new bytes at the end.

The cachedev's don't know anything about the bdev size, so (according to 
Kent) they will "just work" by referencing new offsets that didn't exist 
before when IOs come through.  (This is basically the same as resizing the 
bdev and then unregister/re-register which is how we resize bdevs now.)

As for resizing a cachedev, I've not looked at all---not sure about that 
one.  We always detach, resize, make-bcache and re-attach the new cache.  
Maybe it is similarly simple, but haven't looked.

Maintaining a blind structure population from a userspace page would be 
difficult as well because even if the kernel validates _everything_ in 
cache_sb today, anyone extending `struct cache_sb` needs to remember to 
add checks for that. Failing to enforce validation inside the kernel could 
lead to kernel crashes or data corruption from userspace which is of 
course never good.

We always assume that, somehow, someone could leverage an insecure IOCTL 
call and crash the OS when they shouldn't be allowed to (even if they are 
not root, like from sudo).  This is a security issue from an assurance and 
integrity point of view, even if there might be neither an obvious 
privelege escalation nor privacy concern.
