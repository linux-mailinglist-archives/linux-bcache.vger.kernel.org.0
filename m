I hope you are doing great?
 
This is Felix from Toronto-Canada. I have a lucrative business 
offer that will benefit us both immensely within a very short 
period of time. However, I need your initial approval of interest 
prior to further and complete details regarding the deal.
 
Thanks,
 
Felix.
