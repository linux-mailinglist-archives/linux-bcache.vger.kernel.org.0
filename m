Hello and good day,
 
My name is Charles, and I am contacting you to know first and 
foremost, if your private or company bank account in Japan or 
elsewhere can receive a total of 15 Million US Dollars 
(Approximately 1.6 Billion JPÂ¥) at the shortest notice? If yes, 
then kindly reply for further and complete details.
 
Expecting your reply as soon as possible because we have limited 
time to have this fund in your nominated bank account.
 
Doumo Arigatou.
 
Charles Renfroe.
Toronto-Canada
