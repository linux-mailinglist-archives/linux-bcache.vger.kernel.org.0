Subject: [PATCH] bcache: Add support for live resize of backing devices

Signed-off-by: Andrea Tomassetti <andrea.tomassetti-opensource@devo.com>
---
Hi Coly,
Here is the first version of the patch. There are some points I noted down
that I would like to discuss with you:
  - I found it pretty convenient to hook the call of the new added function
    inside the `register_bcache`. In fact, every time (at least from my
    understandings) a disk changes size, it will trigger a new probe and,
    thus, `register_bcache` will be triggered. The only inconvenient
    is that, in case of success, the function will output
    `error: capacity changed` even if it's not really an error.
  - I'm using `kvrealloc`, introduced in kernel version 5.15, to resize
    `stripe_sectors_dirty` and `full_dirty_stripes`. It shouldn't be a
    problem, right?
  - There is some reused code between this new function and
    `bcache_device_init`. Maybe I can move `const size_t max_stripes` to
    a broader scope or make it a macro, what do you think?

Thank you very much,
Andrea
