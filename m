Hi,

not claiming to know "the best" strategy, but I would recommend

  - use a single bcache device on the host

  - either use LVM (thick provisioned) to provide block devices
    to VMs, or put a filesystem on it and store qcow2 files there as
    you did before

With lvm-thin you have all metadata activity for all your VMs in one
place. Any error there and you might lose all your VM storage at once.
Of course you should do regular backups of your VMs anyway, but I would
not start using lvm-thin unless I can have the relevant metadata volume
on redundant storage because of the blast radius.
Just my paranoic 2c :-)

Speaking of blast radius: adding an SSD to the stack will make your VMs
storage performance and availability depend on two devices, not just
one, so this might increase your failure rate. Choose a high-quality
SSD, preferably datacenter-grade equipment. And of course, do your own
performance tests to see if there is enough performance improvement to
justify the higher risk of failure.
