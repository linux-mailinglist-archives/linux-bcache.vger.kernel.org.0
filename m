First, you may want to check if there is any dirty data in the cache, by
executing:
cat /sys/block/bcache0/bcache/state
cat /sys/block/bcache1/bcache/state

If these return "clean", then you should be good to detach the cache.

You will want to try it *before* removing the faulty NVMe storage (which
would obviously make the cache device inaccessible).
