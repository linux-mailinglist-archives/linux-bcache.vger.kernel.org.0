You do great work on bcache, I appreciate everything you do.  No need to 
be embarrassed, this is just a hard bug to pin down!

You might try this for testing:

1. Format with -w 4096

2. Add some WARN_ONCE's around metadata and journal IO operations and run 
   it through your stress test to see what turns up.  The -w 4096 will 
   guarantee that all userspace IOs are 4k aligned, and then if any WARN's 
   trigger then they are suspect.  Even on 512-byte cache deployments we 
   should target 4k-aligned meta IOs hitting the SSD cache.  This would
   fix 2 things:

      a. It will guarantee that all journal/meta IOs are aligned to 4k for 
         4k cache users.

      b. Fix Adriano's performance issues since for at least his Hynix 
         SSD because 512b IOs are ‾6x high latency than 4k IOs on his 
         system.
